## Problem Statement

This project covers the end-to-end data workflow for analyzing seasonal data related to rainfall patterns and energy consumption. It includes creating cloud storage in Amazon S3, loading data into Snowflake, performing data transformations using Snowflake SQL, and building interactive visualizations in Power BI and Tableau. The goal is to deliver actionable insights on rainfall grouping, energy usage, and cost-saving trends.

## Steps Followed

- **Step 1:** Creating Amazon S3 Bucket & Loading Data into it.
- **Step 2:** Creating the Snowflake role and integration object; updating trust policies for secure data connection.
- **Step 3:** Loading data from S3 into Snowflake data warehouse.
- **Step 4:** Data understanding and profiling inside Snowflake.
- **Step 5:** Data transformation using Snowflake SQL including calculation of rainfall groups.
- **Step 6:** Importing data into Power BI from Snowflake.
- **Step 7:** Adding a Rainfall Analysis page and other report pages to the Power BI report.
- **Step 8:** Publishing the Power BI report to Power BI Service.
- **Step 9:** Connecting Snowflake to Tableau software.
- **Step 10:** Creating charts for monthly energy usage consumption.
- **Step 11:** Creating charts for cost savings.
- **Step 12:** Designing comprehensive dashboards in Tableau.
- **Step 13:** Publishing the Tableau workbook to Tableau Cloud.

## Features & Insights

- Secure cloud-based data storage using Amazon S3.
- Robust data warehousing and transformation in Snowflake.
- Rainfall data segmentation and detailed analysis across seasons.
- Interactive visualizations and dashboards in Power BI and Tableau.
- Time series analytics on energy consumption and cost savings.
- Integration across AWS, Snowflake, Power BI, and Tableau platforms ensuring a streamlined data analytics ecosystem.

## How to Use

1. Set up Amazon S3 bucket for raw data storage.
2. Configure Snowflake roles and integration according to AWS trust policies.
3. Load and transform data inside Snowflake SQL environment.
4. Import data to Power BI and create detailed rainfall and usage reports.
5. Publish Power BI reports for internal consumption.
6. Connect Tableau to Snowflake for advanced visualizations.
7. Build and publish Tableau dashboards for wider stakeholder access.
8. Continuously update data in S3 and refresh dashboards regularly.

## Additional Notes

- Ensure correct IAM permissions set in AWS for seamless data flow to Snowflake.
- Snowflake SQL queries should be maintained as data and business requirements evolve.
- Monitor dashboard performance and refresh schedules post-deployment.
- Tableau and Power BI connection setups require secure credential management.
